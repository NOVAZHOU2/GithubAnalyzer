Adjust allocators in curlx/fopen to use curl's in normal builds, and system allocators in TrackMemory builds to avoid recursion.  This allows to switch curlx/multibyte functions to curl allocators in all configurations, as they are no longer called by curlx/fopen, and a recursive call can no longer happen.  After this patch the system allocator is only used in TrackMemory Windows builds, within curlx `fopen`, `freopen`, `stat` and `open` functions.  Also: - test 1, 440, 767: raise allocation limitsto fit the extra allocations   in Windows Unicode builds. - replace all uses of `curlx_unicodefree()` macro with `curlx_free()`   across the codebase. - curlx/multibyte: delete `curlx_unicodefree()`. - ldap: join Windows and non-Windows codepaths that became   identical after moving from `curlx_unicodefree()` to `curlx_free()`. - vauth: drop a strdup from standard to curl allocator since   the original allocation is now already done by curl's. - tool_doswin: drop now superfluous strdup from `FindWin32CACert()`. - memanalyzer.pm: sync weirdo `calloc` log message with `malloc`'s.

It resulted in a 10-30% (Linux), 15% (macOS), 100% (2x, on Windows) slowdown of runtest steps. It also made some jobs exceed their time limits and fail (seen with the Windows ARM64 job.)  Turns out the overhead was caused by calling `memanalyze.pl` as an external process (twice per test), which in turn had to load a full Perl stack from scratch each time.  Fix by converting memanalyze to a Perl modul, loaded as part of `runtests.pl`, which eliminated the overhead completely.  It also sped up existing jobs where memanalyze was run for a long time, e.g. two c-ares Windows jobs, saving 4.5m per CI run.

Before this patch, Find modules returned detected dependency properties (header dirs, libs, libdirs, C flags, etc.) via global variables. curl's main `CMakeLists.txt` copied their values into global lists, which it later applied to targets. This solution worked internally, but it was unsuited for the public, distributed `CURLConfig.cmake` and publishing curl's Find modules with it, due to polluting the namespace of consumer projects. It's also impractical to apply the many individual variables to every targets depending on libcurl.  To allow using Find modules in consumer projects, this patch makes them define as imported interface targets, named `CURL::<dependency>`. Then store dependency information as target properties. It avoids namespace pollution and makes the dependency information apply automatically to all targets using `CURL::libcurl_static`.  Find modules continue to return `*_FOUND` and `*_VERSION` variables.  For dependencies detected via `pkg-config`, CMake 3.16+ is recommended. Older CMake versions have a varying degree of support for propagating/handling library directories. This may cause issues in envs where dependencies reside in non-system locations and detected via `pkg-config` (e.g. macOS + Homebrew). Use `CURL_USE_PKGCONFIG=OFF` to fix these issues. Or upgrade to newer CMake, or link libcurl dynamically.  Also: - re-enable `pkg-config` for old cmake `find_library()` integration   tests. - make `curlinfo` build after these changes. - distribute local Find modules. - export the raw list of lib dependencies via `CURL_LIBRARIES_PRIVATE`. - `CURLconfig.cmake`: use curl's Find modules to detect dependencies in   the consumer env. - add custom property to target property debug function. - the curl build process no longer modifies `CMAKE_C_FLAGS`.

curl/curl,https://github.com/curl/curl,193cb00,Viktor Szakats,2025-10-08T00:33:19Z,"build: stop overriding standard memory allocation functions  Before this patch curl used the C preprocessor to override standard memory allocation symbols: malloc, calloc, strdup, realloc, free. The goal of these is to replace them with curl's debug wrappers in `CURLDEBUG` builds, another was to replace them with the wrappers calling user-defined allocators in libcurl. This solution needed a bunch of workarounds to avoid breaking external headers: it relied on include order to do the overriding last. For ""unity"" builds it needed to reset overrides before external includes. Also in test apps, which are always built as single source files. It also needed the `(symbol)` trick to avoid overrides in some places. This would still not fix cases where the standard symbols were macros. It was also fragile and difficult to figure out which was the actual function behind an alloc or free call in a specific piece of code. This in turn caused bugs where the wrong allocator was accidentally called.  To avoid these problems, this patch replaces this solution with `curlx_`-prefixed allocator macros, and mapping them _once_ to either the libcurl wrappers, the debug wrappers or the standard ones, matching the rest of the code in libtests.  This concludes the long journey to avoid redefining standard functions in the curl codebase.  Note: I did not update `packages/OS400/*.c` sources. They did not `#include` `curl_setup.h`, `curl_memory.h` or `memdebug.h`, meaning the overrides were never applied to them. This may or may not have been correct. For now I suppressed the direct use of standard allocators via a local `.checksrc`. Probably they (except for `curlcl.c`) should be updated to include `curl_setup.h` and use the `curlx_` macros.  This patch changes mappings in two places: - `lib/curl_threads.c` in libtests: Before this patch it mapped to   libcurl allocators. After, it maps to standard allocators, like   the rest of libtests code. - `units`: before this patch it mapped to standard allocators. After, it   maps to libcurl allocators.  Also: - drop all position-dependent `curl_memory.h` and `memdebug.h` includes,   and delete the now unnecessary headers. - rename `Curl_tcsdup` macro to `curlx_tcsdup` and define like the other   allocators. - map `curlx_strdup()` to `_strdup()` on Windows (was: `strdup()`).   To fix warnings silenced via `_CRT_NONSTDC_NO_DEPRECATE`. - multibyte: map `curlx_convert_*()` to `_strdup()` on Windows   (was: `strdup()`). - src: do not reuse the `strdup` name for the local replacement. - lib509: call `_strdup()` on Windows (was: `strdup()`). - test1132: delete test obsoleted by this patch. - CHECKSRC.md: update text for `SNPRINTF`. - checksrc: ban standard allocator symbols.

Create connections with `conn->bits.close = FALSE` and remove all the `connkeep()` calls in protocol handlers setup/connect implementations. `PROTOPT_CONN_REUSE` assures that the default behaviour applies at the end of a transfer without need to juggle the close bit.  `conn->bits.close` now serves as an additional indication that a connection cannot be reused. Only protocol handles that allow reuse need to set it to override the default behaviour.  Remove all `connclose()` and `connkeep()` calls from connection filters. Filters should not modify connection flags. They are supposed to run in eyeballing situations where a filter is just one of many determining the outcome.  Fix http response header handling to only honour `Connection: close` for HTTP/1.x versions.  Closes #19333,https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/feea96851230c7a5a11feaffa0a5e4a4d30e5e63
