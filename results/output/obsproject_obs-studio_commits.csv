Removes the crash handler sentinel earlier when the main window is closed, preventing unclean shutdown warnings when a plugin causes issues. While not ideal, the dialog is not useful when we cannot specify which plugin caused the problem.  Increases shutdown priority of the main application so that when OBS interrupts the session ending, CEF is not closed at the same time. This fixes a crash.  Additional safeguards and event handling to try to ensure a smoother shutdown.",https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/commit/14572498dcf6e226510ecaba6a31496960b120dc

When a user picks a default device, the device_id setting is 'default', which prevents any comparison. The comparison is done by leveraging the libobs/audio-monitoring devices_match function. For macOS, some special care is taken because the devices list differ for 'Desktop Audio' and 'monitoring' since coreaudio sdk has no pure audio capture; so 'default' in the two lists do not match in general.

Prior to [1] however, any invalid surfaces were (likely accidentally) treated as 32BGRA. And as it turns out, any IOSurface received from Syphon does not have the pixel format set, thus returning 0. Because the pixel format happens to always be 32BGRA, this was never caught. [1] then slightly refactored the code, fixing the bug not realizing it ever existed. This lead to Syphon no longer working.  Treating 0 as 32BGRA appears to be the only way to fix this situation for now and restore prior behavior. Ideally in the future Syphon provides valid IOSurfaces. An upstream fix to Syphon-Framework is already submitted, however even if merged, servers would need to update to that fixed version before things work again. Therefore, this workaround is needed on the OBS side.  However, the plan for now is for the Metal renderer to not get this relaxation. It never had it (so Syphon never worked there, making this not a regression) and it's marked as experimental. Hopefully, by the time it's stable and/or default, Syphon will be fixed and servers have been updated.

Additionally, it implements loading of a manifest file for plugins that allows plugin authors to provide more detailed information about the plugin including authors, support site, name, description.  In order to accomplish this, this change updates libobs to provide more detailed tracking of modules- specifically tracking both enabled and disabled modules, alone with a module load state which indicates why a module is not loaded. Additionally, changes were made to establish a links between a module and any features (inputs, outputs, encoders, and services) it provides (and thus the ability to determine why a feature might not be enabled). Along with these changes to modules, this commit also provides an indicator and lookup for core modules which can not be disabled by the plugin manager.

It was never even fully implemented in the UI. In fact, the properties view *only* supports it for obs_property_list, despite the API theoretically allowing any data/property type. 3. The core obs_data seems like the wrong place for this kind of interaction between plugins and UI. obs_data should carry data from one place to another, some built-in feedback mechanism for the other direction doesn't make too much sense.

This means that if one encoder stalls and does not submit packets for a while the interleaver can end up with a permanent increase to its delay due to multiple packets being received from the other encoders without being able to send any.  This change introduces a recovery mechanism that relies on an upper bound for the amount of packets that may become ""streamable"" at a time being calculated, and flushing additional packets if that bound is violated.  The upper bound is based on the largest expected interval between packets and how many packets for each encoder could arrive within double that interval (to give us a bit of wiggle room since not all encoders will deliver frames 100% consistently).  This ensures that we still send data at a steady rate but allow the buffer to drain if it becomes larger than it needs to be.",https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/commit/e4c39eb648cf8a400f035386bfe7a7204a042ab6
