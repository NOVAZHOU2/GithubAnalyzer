NETIO.SYS is part of Windows since NT6 (Vista).  The driver is not feature complete (meaning some functionality is unimplemented) but does its job quite good for what it originally was written for (which is getting WinDRBD working on ReactOS/Windows Server 2003 SP2).  The driver re-uses parts of the AFD.SYS driver, namely those functions that ease communitating with the transport device interface (TDI). Other than that, following features are implemented and should work:   * TCP/IP networking: connect, listen, accept, read, write  * UDP/IP networking: write  So in a nutshell TCP/IP support is completed, UDP support is partially complete and ICMP support does not exist yet. In particular the listen/accept mechanism allows one to write kernel side TCP servers that one can connect to via the internet.  The netio driver is licensed under the MIT license, see the file netio.c for more details.

An array of pointers isn't conformant on 64-bit and will overrun the destination buffer when unmarshalling. Since the purpose of this function is to test a conformant FC_BOGUS_STRUCT, use one that is conformant on both 32-bit and 64-bit.  The revised test coincidentally reveals that there is a problem with the padding or alignment after a marshalled 16-bit enum, which will need to be addressed separately.

In cases where this could have been use-after-free, exceptions were caught/hidden by RpcTryFinally, but still lead to leaks since NdrProxyFreeBuffer wasn't able to call IRPCChannelBuffer::FreeBuffer.  StdProxy_GetChannel() now AddRef() on its return value (used to set __proxy_frame::_StubMsg::pRpcChannelBuffer), and NdrProxyFreeBuffer() calls the corresponding Release() and clears the now-weak pointer. This makes the behavior of these function match the observed test results, and fixes the crash/leak when a proxy is released mid-Invoke.  wine commit id a7be4256f6081684e8fb0258564f9358eb36cfcf by Kevin Puetz <PuetzKevinA@JohnDeere.com>  [WINESYNC] rpcrt4/tests: Add tests for lifetime of IRpcChannelBuffer.  It's possible for a proxy to be released during the middle of an Invoke. E.g. a specific case where this happened was a single-shot event sink which, upon receiving the event it was waiting for, would immediately call DispEventUnadvise. This removed the proxy pointing to that sink from the connection point's list of subscribers and released the last refcount on the proxy itself.  Therefore, all state used to complete an RPC call must be on the stack; once NdrProxySendReceive pumps STA messages and permits reentrancy, the proxy cannot be accessed or relied on to own anything.  Add test showing MIDL_STUB_MESSAGE::pRpcChannelBuffer owns a refcount (to ensure it can read [out] parameters from the channel)  wine commit id 59f39b325d2d90c09c8b346ba241dab182084c7b by Kevin Puetz <PuetzKevinA@JohnDeere.com>  [WINESYNC] rpcrt4: Set the name of internal threads.  wine commit id 3f0166fa89616e409e0381415e23302479100d3a by Brendan Shanks <bshanks@codeweavers.com>  [KERNEL32_VISTA] Import SetThreadDescription from wine-10.0  [WINESYNC] rpcrt4: Add SEH annotations to NdrClientCall2().  wine commit id bad509227aa534f152a17316bdcf221436f03284 by Zebediah Figura <zfigura@codeweavers.com>  [WINESYNC] rpcrt4: Make NdrClientCall2() SEH-compatible.  wine commit id a5322fc94fa7333a09456a551d70eb1bf5a8fdbd by Zebediah Figura <zfigura@codeweavers.com>  [WINESYNC] rpcrt4: Add SEH annotations to NdrClientCall3().  wine commit id 5d01faed777fadf6cb7882d8c8dc3bdfd26dd2e3 by Zebediah Figura <zfigura@codeweavers.com>  [WINESYNC] rpcrt4: Make NdrClientCall3() SEH-compatible.  wine commit id abe75a5f22d82d0b35d67ae9d531d49a3d67d09f by Zebediah Figura <zfigura@codeweavers.com>  [WINESYNC] rpcrt4: Add SEH annotations to Ndr64AsyncClientCall().  wine commit id 37ae068773677a35342a594448d1bbabf9feb94a by Zebediah Figura <zfigura@codeweavers.com>  [WINESYNC] rpcrt4: Make Ndr64AsyncClientCall() SEH-compatible.  wine commit id 16713f52456d86c34eb5f0268468e044ada9d162 by Zebediah Figura <zfigura@codeweavers.com>  [WINESYNC] rpcrt4: Implement I_RpcBindingInqLocalClientPID().

Omit the ""winetest_"" prefix to match the other Wine test functions and so the underlying winetest_wait_child_process() function can be wrapped with the usual line-capturing macros.

This change aligns mingw-w64 with the more commonly used value across Unix-like systems and other C libraries.  The old value of 0x3000 may have caused compatibility issues when working with code that assumes the standard 0x6000 value for S_IFBLK.  This update improves cross-platform compatibility and consistency with other systems, making it easier to write portable code that deals with file type identification. It also reduces potential confusion and errors that might arise from the non-standard value.  One of these is for example python. This is only an example. It does not change the fact that python should be more careful about actual value implementation.  Note that the current value implies character device + FIFO instead of character device + directory.

reactos/reactos,https://github.com/reactos/reactos,ecf718e,Hermès Bélusca-Maïto,2025-09-14T16:21:00Z,"[POWRPROF] Fix how & when the global registry semaphore is initialized (#8387)  CORE-19104  This fixes failure to create or open the `PowerProfileRegistrySemaphore`, when it has been first created by a Process1 using powrprof from a ""User1"", and while this process stays running, the semaphore is attempted to be re-created (or opened) by another Process2 using powrprof from a different ""User2"".  For example, this happens when ""User1"" is either the LocalSystem account with the Process1 being Winlogon.exe (via the msgina.dll -> powrprof.dll dependency), or, ""Administrator"" with the explorer.exe process when opening the ""Shutdown"" dialog (via the shell32.dll -> runtime-loading of msgina.dll -> powrprof.dll dependency), AND, ""User2"" being a non-administrator user and Process2 being explorer.exe, again when opening the ""Shutdown"" dialog. In this situation, msgina.dll fails to be loaded, because powrprof.dll fails in its `DllMain()` routine -- see log excerpt below --, and the shell falls back to a minimal shutdown confirmation dialog.  ``` err:(dll\win32\powrprof\powrprof.c:1420) Couldn't create Semaphore: 5 (dll\ntdll\ldr\ldrinit.c:879) LDR: DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH for dll ""powrprof.dll"" (InitRoutine: 7ADC6DB0) failed (dll\win32\kernel32\client\loader.c:386) LoadLibraryExW(msgina.dll) failing with status c0000142 err:(dll\win32\powrprof\powrprof.c:1420) Couldn't create Semaphore: 5 (dll\ntdll\ldr\ldrinit.c:879) LDR: DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH for dll ""powrprof.dll"" (InitRoutine: 7ADC6DB0) failed (dll\win32\kernel32\client\loader.c:386) LoadLibraryExW(msgina.dll) failing with status c0000142 (dll\ntdll\ldr\ldrutils.c:2340) Image explorer.exe has no exports, but were trying to get procedure (null).
