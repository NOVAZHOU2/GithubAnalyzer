We need to do this since normally the scenes are reparented in the 'arrange_{children,container}' functions but these don't get called for disabled workspaces. However, the 'arrange_{children,container}' functions also don't get called when there is a fullscreen container hiding them.  This commit makes sure to call 'disable_workspace' on workspaces with a fullscreen container so that when a container is moved into the workspace its scenes will be properly reparented. Also, when there is a fullscreen global container 'disable_workspace' is called for all workspaces since the scenes of a previously fullscreen global container may still be parented in the 'fullscreen_global' layer.

In order to avoid having to wait on the user's process, a double-fork was used, which in turn required us to wait on the outer process. In order to track the child PID for launcher purposes, a pipe was used to transmit the PID back to sway.  This resulted in sway blocking for 5-6 ms per exec on my system, which is quite significant. The error handling was also quite lacking - the read loop did not handle errors at all for example.  Instead, teach sway to handle SIGCHLD and do away with the double-fork. This in turn allows us to get rid of the pipe as we can record the child's PID directly. This reduces the time we block to just 1.5 ms on my system. We'd be able to get down to just 150 µs if we could use posix_spawn(3), but posix_spawn(3) cannot reset NOFILE. clone(2) or vfork(2) would be alternatives, but that presents portability issues.

If an output is destroyed while a repaint timer is pending, future frame callbacks will no longer occur as the listener is torn down in begin_destroy, but the repaint timer is not torn down and may still fire until output_destroy is hit. As begin_destroy cleared the reference to wlr_output, this leads to a NULL-pointer dereference.  Tear down the repaint timer in begin_destroy as there is no need for it.

A library that is affected by this is the libappindicator-gtk3* library and it can cause tray icons to be missing after starting swaybar due to a race condition, as follows: * An application using libappindicator-gtk3 starts, e.g. nm-applet. * Some time later, swaybar starts. * swaybar creates the StatusNotifierWatcher. * libappindicator-gtk3 observes the new watcher, but it sees that   IsStatusNotifierHostRegistered=false, so it falls back to the   Freedesktop System tray protocol. * swaybar creates the StatusNotifierHost.   At this point, libappindicator-gtk3 should ""un-fallback"" back to SNI.   However, since swaybar does not emit the PropertiesChange signal on   IsStatusNotifierHostRegistered, libappindicator-gtk3 doesn't get   notified, and stays in fallback state forever. * As a result, nm-applet will not show in the swaybar tray.
