We also seem to confuse the presence of this feature to mean that the compositor will always give us non-parametric image descriptions but these two things have no relation with each other. Remove the feature check and use `wl->supports_parametric` to decide if we want to use `get_preferred` or `get_preferred_parametric` instead.  This also removes error messages for when the compositor doesn't support parametric descriptions or when the compositor doesn't support icc_v2_v4.  The user needs to set `icc-profile-auto` for the icc_file path to work properly which isn't ideal but I'm not sure what to do about this and likely won't make any big changes right before a release.,https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/commit/b3abe3975b65d8de1bf903fd6991055bc4b81cb8

This will cause us to believe target_params get changed on every frame, and we'll end up in a state where wayland events happen in the following order indefinitely:    -> wp_color_management_surface_v1#45.set_image_description(...)   -> wp_color_management_surface_v1#45.unset_image_description()   -> wl_surface#9.commit()   -> wp_color_management_surface_v1#45.set_image_description(...)   -> wp_color_management_surface_v1#45.unset_image_description()   -> wl_surface#9.commit()  Since image_description is double buffered, we always queue an unset to the pending state before each commit. As a result, no commit ever carries a valid image_description.  Taking the sample file in the issue as an example, we end up in this state because the file has `min_luma == 0` but `pl_color_space_infer` normalizes this value to `min_luma == 0.000001`. This makes it so that we store a different `target_param` to `vo_wayland_state` on every frame than the one received from `vo_get_target_params`. So we end up setting image description on every frame in this case.  The key problem here is that `set_color_management` isn't blocking the thread until `set_image_description is called`, so vo->driver->flip_page is called before this finishes.  This commit fixes the problem by doing any operations that could change `wl->target_param` first before doing any equality checks to skip changing to image description pointlessly.  This fixes the problem in the issue that image_description is never set on such files. The synchronization problem is fixed in a later commit, because otherwise setting image_description on every frame could have adverse frame time effects  Fixes: https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/issues/16825",https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/commit/f0883cdde1ca6d08d5423b1a9ace77ef0dd7ebc2

X11 already does this, and win32 does not need to do this since the input events are processed in the UI thread, not VO thread.  However, this is not done on wayland. On wayland, input events are only processed in vo_wayland_wait_frame and vo_wayland_wait_events.  If Vulkan gpu api is used, then vo_wayland_wait_frame is only called in wayland_vk_swap_buffers, and only when using the internal vsync, and not when fifo protocol is being used.  vo_wayland_wait_events is only called in wait_vo. However, unlike VOCTRL_CHECK_EVENTS which is sent on every VO render loop, wait_vo is not called when the VO has a frame to redraw immediately, which can happen often in display-sync modes. In the worst case, this is never called.  All of the above result in situations where inputs and other wayland events not being handled in time while not rendering, or rapid rendering with wayland internal vsync disabled.  Fix this by checking wayland events in VOCTRL_CHECK_EVENTS, similar to X11, to make sure these events are handled.",https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/commit/bde63fe092a9eb285b92834cfe403df17018d04d

As we do not require Vulkan to be newer than 1.2, we must request the 1.3 and 1.4 features via their original original extensions, while the others can use the core feature structs.  This change assumes that libplacebo can correctly merge features using their old extensions or using the core feature structs.",https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/commit/12a78257a8bca10f6f1d01a8857f82d18d93f7d5
