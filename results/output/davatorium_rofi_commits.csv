It is useful so that when you  use a keyboard shortcut to start rofi it will always popup on the window you are working on and so it doesn't make you refocus/move your head on large monitors :)  * Fixed other windows to be focusable in transient mode  and added print_help_msg for this new -transient-window option.  * Added -transient-window option to doc too",https://github.com/davatorium/rofi/commit/5133f50f309707ae2e6b229bc95adcc907f8a7d9
