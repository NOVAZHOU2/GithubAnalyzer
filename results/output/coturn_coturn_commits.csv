This causes the server to create excessive relay threads and database connections, leading to resource exhaustion and performance issues.  ## Solution Added a new `cpus` configuration option that allows manual override of CPU detection:  ### Command Line Usage ```bash turnserver --cpus 2 ```  ### Configuration File Usage ```ini # Override system CPU count detection for containers cpus=2 ```  ## Key Features - **Backward Compatible**: No changes needed for existing deployments - **Input Validation**: Values must be between 1 and 128 with proper error handling - **Comprehensive Documentation**: Updated man pages and example config files - **Both Interfaces**: Works via command line and configuration file  ## Testing The implementation has been thoroughly tested:  ```bash # Container with 2 allocated CPUs on 128-CPU host $ turnserver --cpus 2 INFO: System cpu num is 128       # Host detection INFO: System enable num is 128    # Host detection   INFO: Configured cpu num is 2     # Override applied INFO: Total General servers: 2    # Correct thread count ```  - ✅ Command line option: `--cpus 8` creates 8 relay servers - ✅ Config file option: `cpus=6` creates 6 relay servers   - ✅ Error handling: Invalid values show appropriate errors - ✅ Default behavior: Without option, uses system detection - ✅ RFC5769 tests: All protocol tests still pass  ## Files Modified - `src/apps/relay/mainrelay.c` - Core implementation - `src/apps/relay/mainrelay.h` - Added configuration flag - `examples/etc/turnserver.conf` - Added documentation and example - `man/man1/turnserver.1` - Updated man page  This change directly addresses the resource consumption issues in containerized environments while maintaining full backward compatibility.

Specifically, if `addr_bind()`, `event_new()`, or `event_add()` fails, the function now closes the socket and frees memory to prevent leaks.  ### Expected Behavior  On any failure during socket binding or event registration, both `udp_fd` and `server_addr` should be released to avoid leaking system resources.  ### Actual Behavior  Previously, if `addr_bind()`, `event_new()`, or `event_add()` failed, the function would return early without closing the socket or freeing memory, causing file descriptor and heap memory leaks.  This patch addresses overlooked memory and resource cleanup on failure paths, improving server stability through targeted and essential changes.  Thanks for reviewing.

This PR removes support for versions of openssl OLDER than 1.1.1 1.1.1 should still be usable after this change is merged.  I don't see any value in supporting 1.1.1, but didn't see a reason to purge support for 1.1.1 when there are so few checks for >= 3.0.  Note that this does also remove CI support for Ubuntu 16.04. The official version of OpenSSL from Ubuntu for this release is listed here: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl as 1.0.2g  Since no newer releases of coturn will be backported by Canonical to Ubuntu 16.04, anyone using Coturn on this operating system will have to download and compile it themselves. They may build their own version of OpenSSL if they somehow cannot upgrade to a newer version of Ubuntu.  My position is that these users should prefer to upgrade to a newer operating system than worry about chasing newer releases of Coturn.

For 4.6.2, the additional size is 24 bytes (4 bytes attribute header, and 20 bytes for ""Coturn-4.6.2 'Gorst'"")  If we are to use an example from #1588, ""A 62 byte request will be met with Coturn’s 401 Unauthorized response which is 150 bytes, a factor of ~2.42."" - without SOFTWARE the response will be 126 bytes which reduces amplification factor to ~2.  As I observed with multiple providers using coturn - some of the are sending it. Meaning, they do not set `--no-software-attribute` - most probably due to lack of clarity about this setting.  I believe sending SOFTWARE_ATTRIBUTE should be off by default which is hinted in the RFC (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8489#section-16.1.2)  Detailed changes: - Extract setting the attribute into a function to avoid code duplication - This option is now not reloadable - The option is now called `software_attribute` because inverse logic creates multiple double-not in the code which makes it harder to read. - `no-software_attribute` is still functional but marked as deprecated in documentation  Test Plan: - Run local tests with different cli arguments (new and deprecated) and confirm SOFTWARE attribute is off by default, and added when arguments say so",https://github.com/coturn/coturn/commit/94fcfadce1149310d811c2e3eb0f99bdf3e06ced
