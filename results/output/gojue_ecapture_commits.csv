The fix ensures that only the actual data length (capped at the maximum buffer size) is read, rather than always reading the full buffer size.

Simplify Data Handling: Removed intermediate JSON parsing on the server (ecaptureq.go) and simplified the event writer logic.

Remove Base64: Eliminated Base64 encoding for event payloads, now sending raw bytes directly within the Protobuf message.  * feat(events): Implement full Protobuf serialization for events  - **Add `ToProtobufEvent()` to Interface:** Introduced a new method to the `IEventStruct` interface to standardize the conversion of events to the `pb.Event` Protobuf format. - **Implement for All Event Types:** Implemented the `ToProtobufEvent()` method for all concrete event structs (OpenSSL, Bash, GoTLS, etc.), mapping their fields to the Protobuf message structure. - **Update Event Processor:** The event processor now uses this new method to create fully structured Protobuf messages before sending them. - **Convert Heartbeat to Protobuf:** Refactored the client heartbeat to also send a structured `pb.Heartbeat` message instead of a custom JSON payload.  * refactor(iworker): Worker now populates final event payload and type  The eventWorker is now responsible for setting the Payload, Length, Type, and UUID on the outgoing Protobuf message. Individual event structs (SSLDataEvent, etc.) now only provide base metadata, decoupling them from the final serialization logic.",https://github.com/gojue/ecapture/commit/3c0b4f571ffa4fef4c9497cc692bca0ffaf02b27

gojue/ecapture,https://github.com/gojue/ecapture,b438a1f,Hugo,2025-06-28T15:33:46Z,"fix: Improve bash path detection and correct probe attachment (#805)  This commit addresses two issues in the bash probe logic:  1.  **Unreliable Bash Path Discovery:** The probe previously relied solely on the `$SHELL` environment variable. This could fail on systems where `$SHELL` is not set to bash (e.g., using zsh or fish) or is not set at all.  2.  **Incorrect Probe Attachment:** When bash was dynamically linked with `libreadline.so`, the probe incorrectly used the path to `libreadline.so` for all function hooks. This failed for functions like `execute_command`, `exec_builtin`, and `exit_builtin` which exist only in the main bash executable, not in the readline library.  This patch introduces the following fixes:  -   Adds a fallback to check for `/bin/bash` if a valid bash path cannot be determined from the `$SHELL` variable. -   Refactors the configuration and probe logic to distinguish between the path to the `bash` executable and the path to `libreadline.so`. -   Ensures that probes for `readline` target either `libreadline.so` (if present) or the `bash` binary, while probes for other bash-internal functions always target the `bash` binary itself.  This change significantly improves the reliability and accuracy of bash command capturing across different system configurations.",https://github.com/gojue/ecapture/commit/b438a1f14014386c5c11124047ac87a08798912b
