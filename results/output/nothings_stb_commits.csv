It's not a sign of a malformed stream for us to be reading past the end there, because the contents of that bit buffer are speculative; it's only a malformed stream if we actually _consume_ the extra bits.  This fix adds some extra logic where we the first time we hit zeof, we add an explicit 16 extra zero bits at the top of the bit buffer just so that for the purposes of the decoder, we have 16 bits in the buffer.  However, if at the end of stream, we have the ""hit zeof once"" flag set and less than 16 bits remaining in the bit buffer, we know some of those implicit zero bits got read, which indicates we actually had a past-end-of-stream read. In that case, flag it as an error.  While I'm in here, also rephrase the length-too-large check to not do any potentially-overflowing pointer arithmetic.

We need an extra case in the Euclidean dvision for INT_MIN / INT_MIN which is a bit annoying but trivial; finally, for two's complement platforms, note that abs(x) = (x > 0) ? x : -x does not work (since for x=INT_MIN, -x still gives INT_MIN), but the equivalent formulation for _negative_ absolute value (x < 0) ? x : -x is always in range and overflow-free, so rewrite the relevant expressions using that negative absolute value instead.

While this is a compiler bug plain and simple, we still have to deal with it.  This is related to the SLP vectorizer, and in particular the two reverse subtracts in the butterflies for the second half to avoid unary negates.  Use the more regular dataflow that has the unary negates in it (we can at least fold one of them into a constant, namely for A2) and introduce a few temporaries that also make alias analysis (and possible block-level vectorization) a whole let easier while I'm at it.  This fixes the codegen issues on Clang 12, which now produces a working decoder, and I expect the single unary negate that we actually gain per iteration of this loop is not a significant perf concern.

Writing this code and then relying on compiler strength reduction to turn it back into shifts feels extremely silly but it is what it is.

Also, the previous patch ensures that n <= 15 for all callers of stbi__extend_receive, so can remove the (less restrictive) bounds check for 0 <= n < 17 (the bounds of stbi__bmask) entirely.
