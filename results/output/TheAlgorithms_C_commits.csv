It's a surprise it was working   so well. * This version just returns 'int' to allow for error checks (instead of   a printf inside the algorithm), and uses double pointers for return   values (good practice) * The usage example contained unnecessary mallocs, switched that out for   scanf. The example is just an example after all, in real applications   you'd have better input sanitazion.",https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/C/commit/2314a195862243e09c485a66194866517a6f8c31
