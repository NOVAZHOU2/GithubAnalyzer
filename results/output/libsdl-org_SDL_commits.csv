In the unlikely case that the overflow check should fail, the else clause would switch to the truncated stack message without updating the len variable. This would contain the return value from vsnprintf(), meaning it could point beyond the buffer.  The subsequent code which trims NL and CR from the buffer, would then read -- and possibly write -- out-of-bounds.  To fix this, we split the two joint conditions into separate if-clauses, and adjust the len variable in the case where we know the message buffer was truncated.",https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/commit/2cb9a4fcc14121305e9a0975ded67bc67a66ae57
