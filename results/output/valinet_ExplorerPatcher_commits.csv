valinet/ExplorerPatcher,https://github.com/valinet/ExplorerPatcher,45bd735,Valentin Radu,2024-04-04T00:38:00Z,"Start10: Prevent menu closing delay when patching standalone (without ExplorerPatcher injecting `explorer.exe`)  The Windows 10 Start menu has a delay when closing if one is injecting it without injecting `explorer.exe` as well. The reason for this is that animations are fixed, which in turn fixes this delay, using code run when ExplorerPatcher is injected in `explorer.exe`. It cannot be patched from the Start menu's host process itself (`StartMenuExperienceHost.exe`) because that doesn't load `twinui.pchsell.dll` where the actual patching happens. This commit works around this shortcoming by employing the old fix for this delay: hiding the Start menu when animations haven't been fixed (so when `explorer.exe` is not injected by ExplorerPatcher).  We needed to detect when animations were successfully patched from `explorer.exe` in order to disable this workaround, thus this commit offers an example on how to create a kernel object, in this case a mutex, that can be 'seen' by a process running inside an app container, as is the case for Start menu's host process (`StartMenuExperienceHost.exe`).",https://github.com/valinet/ExplorerPatcher/commit/45bd73585604b644c95767fef6e92a9f1a11a212
