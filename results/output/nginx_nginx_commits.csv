The fix is to move the qc->error check after c->ssl->handshake_rejected is handled first, to make the error queue cleared.  Although not practicably visible as needed, this is accompanied by clearing the error queue under the qc->error case as well, to be on the safe side.  As an implementation note, due to the way of handling invalid transport parameters for OpenSSL 3.5 and above, which leaves a passed pointer not advanced on error, SSL_get_error() may return either SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ or SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE depending on a library.  To cope with that, both qc->error and c->ssl->handshake_rejected checks were moved out of ""sslerr != SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ"".  Also, this reconstructs a missing ""SSL_do_handshake() failed"" diagnostics for the qc->error case, replacing using ngx_ssl_connection_error() with ngx_connection_error().

Previously, it was not possible to send acknowledgments if the congestion window was limited or temporarily exceeded, such as after sending a large response or MTU probe.  If ACKs were not received from the peer for some reason to update the in-flight bytes counter below the congestion window, this might result in a stalled connection.  The fix is to send ACKs regardless of congestion control.

nginx/nginx,https://github.com/nginx/nginx,18afcda,Sergey Kandaurov,2024-09-20T10:08:42Z,"SSL: optional ssl_client_certificate for ssl_verify_client.  Starting from TLSv1.1 (as seen since draft-ietf-tls-rfc2246-bis-00), the ""certificate_authorities"" field grammar of the CertificateRequest message was redone to allow no distinguished names.  In TLSv1.3, with the restructured CertificateRequest message, this can be similarly done by optionally including the ""certificate_authorities"" extension. This allows to avoid sending DNs at all.  In practice, aside from published TLS specifications, all supported SSL/TLS libraries allow to request client certificates with an empty DN list for any protocol version.  For instance, when operating in TLSv1, this results in sending the ""certificate_authorities"" list as a zero-length vector, which corresponds to the TLSv1.1 specification. Such behaviour goes back to SSLeay.  The change relaxes the requirement to specify at least one trusted CA certificate in the ssl_client_certificate directive, which resulted in sending DNs of these certificates (closes #142).  Instead, all trusted CA certificates can be specified now using the ssl_trusted_certificate directive if needed.  A notable difference that certificates specified in ssl_trusted_certificate are always loaded remains (see 3648ba7db).
