In the original implementation in #5370, the virtual display size was necessarily the same as the capture size. The --max-size value was only allowed to determine the virtual display size when no explicit size was provided.  Since the dpi was scaled down accordingly, it is often better to create a virtual display at the target capture size directly. However, not everything is rendered according to the virtual display DPI. For example, a page in Firefox is rendered too big on small virtual displays. Thus, it makes sense to be able create a virtual display at a given size, and capture it at a lower resolution with --max-size. This is now possible using OpenGL filters.  Therefore, change the behavior of --max-size for virtual displays:  - --max-size does not impact --new-display without size argument    anymore (the virtual display size is the main display size);  - it is used to limit the capture size (whether an explicit size is    provided or not).  This new behavior is consistent with main display capture.
