Since the NFC controller doesn't seem to handle them in hardware and simply bubbles them up, and then the Flipper firmware will just ignore them and refuse to respond afterwards, this causes the reading operation to fail.  This commit adds a simple handler for such Polling commands so that readers behaving like NFC TagInfo could read the emulated card without failing.  * Only handle cases when System Code is not FFFF  The NFC controller should handle Polling commands with the System Code set to FFFF, so it's not necessary for the firmware to handle it.  * Remove system code logging  * More cleanups  * Remove the claim that we need a poller change  We already have enough information to determine whether or not the card supports NDEF since SYS_OP register value is included in all current Lite-S card dumps.  * Respond to 12FC polling command when needed  * Handle Polling with NDEF and Lite-S Service Code  This allows the reader to specifically select the service by naming the Service Code.  * Introduce API for manual handling of Polling commands  Introduce nfc_felica_listener_timer_anticol_start() and nfc_felica_listener_timer_anticol_stop(). These are for now just wrappers around the block_tx timer that can be used to delay the response until the desired Time Slot. Thanks to the loose timing constraints of FeliCa collision resolution protocol, no compensation seems to be necessary. Also enabled the block_tx timer for FeliCa listener, but with both compensation and fdt set to 0 to keep the original behavior of not using the timer during normal data exchange.  This API is now being used for handling Polling commands that are not handled by the NFC controller on the hardware side.  * Document target_time_slot  * Implement changes suggested by @RebornedBrain  * api: f18 version sync  * nfc: added stubs for `nfc_felica_listener_timer_anticol` for unit tests  ---------  Co-authored-by: hedger <hedger@users.noreply.github.com> Co-authored-by: hedger <hedger@nanode.su>",https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware/commit/dfd753703ad10177aa133154c8125d53720c8d2e
