You can explore the idea behind the modules at: https://mox-configurator.turris.cz/  More information about Turris MOX can be found here: https://docs.turris.cz/hw/mox/intro/  Also works with Turris Shield (Turris MOX A and C with a simplified OS UI).  Specifications: -----------------------  MOX A - SoC: Marvell Armada 3720 - RAM: 512/1024 MB, DDR3 - Memory:     - 8 MB SPI NOR Flash for U-Boot and rescue system     - SD card slot - 1x RJ-45, 1Gbps - 1x USB 3.0 - 1x activity LED - 1x reset button - SDIO header - misc pin header (UART, GPIO, JTAG, ...)  MOX B, G - 1x mPCIe slot - 1x SIM slot  MOX C - 4x RJ-45, 1Gbps  MOX D - SFP, 2.5Gbps  MOX E - 8x RJ-45, 1Gbps  MOX F - 4x USB 3.0  Module support: -----------------------  Additional packages are needed for some modules.  MOX A (core) - works as is  MOX B, G (mPCIe, mPCIe passthrough) - works as is  MOX C, E (4x, 8x RJ-45) - kmod-dsa - kmod-dsa-mv88e6xxx  MOX D (SFP) - kmod-sfp - kmod-phy-marvell-10g  MOX F (4x USB 3.0) - works as is  Wi-Fi 5, 3x3 card (WLE900VX) - kmod-ath10k - ath10k-board-qca988x - ath10k-firmware-qca988x  Wi-Fi 6, DBDC, 2x2 card (MT7915DAN) - kmod-mt7915e - kmod-mt7915-firmware  Interface naming: -----------------------  - MOX A's RJ-45 is assigned to `eth0`. - MOX C, E (4x, 8x RJ-45) are assigned to `lan<number>@eth1` - If MOX D (SFP) is connected directly to MOX A, the resulting interface   is `eth1`. If it's connected through MOX E (8x RJ-45), the resulting   interface is `sfp@eth1`.  Quirks: -----------------------  - MOX is sensitive to the order of connected modules. Verify that the   confguration is valid at: https://mox-configurator.turris.cz/ - `CONFIG_MOXTET` and `CONFIG_GPIO_MOXTET` need to be enabled in kernel   config. Moxtet is a bus protocol needed to discover and configure MOX   modules. It must be compiled into the kernel for the modules to work.   Though it's very small so it won't bloat up the kernel image.  Flashing instructions: -----------------------  1. Download `openwrt-*-ext4-sdcard.img.gz` and `gunzip` it. 2. Insert an SD card and flash the image to it using dd:    dd if=openwrt-*-ext4-sdcard.img.gz of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=4096 conv=fsync 3. Plug the SD card into MOX.

The SOC itself provides 2.4G wifi while 5G wifi is added by either an IPQ5018-specific QCN6122 (2x2) solution or by the more generally available PCIe-based QCN9074 (4x4) wifi chip.  On IPQ5018/QCN6122-based boards, both QCN6122 and IPQ5018 wifi is initialized by IPQ5018 firmware which comes in different versions: - IPQ5018: firmware files to initialize WCSS and the internal wifi chip - IPQ5018/QCN6122: above + additional firmware segments to initialize the QCN6122 chip incl. (de-)assertion of resets and clocks enablement  OpenWrt currently packages the combined IPQ5018/QCN6122 firmware for both architectures. As such, let's switch to using IPQ5018-only firmware for boards not packed with QCN6122 chip(s) and keep using the shared firmware for devices that do have QCN6122(s) chips. This helps us move to using upstreamed IPQ5018 firmware while using the legacy repo for IPQ5018/QCN6122 firmware and rule out any initialization conflicts/issues caused by loading QCN6122 on IPQ5018-only boards.  While at it, default to the secure WCSS remoteproc driver sent upstream for review, move QCN6122 wifi nodes to a separate dtsi, override the Q6 node to load the multi-PD-based architecture remoteproc driver for needed only by IPQ5018/QCN6122 designs, reference said dtsi in boards packed with QCN6122 wifi chip(s), and add provision for migrating the radio path as the wifi nodes now adhere to linux device tree naming conventions.

This is because iface_wpa_stations and iface_sae_stations return early if there are no wifi-stations present, which is an incorrect behavior as it causes the file to actually have old entries.  'sae_password_file' and 'wpa_psk_file' are also set by default inside of iface_auth_type to same path as the one used by wifi-station, so it is indeed going to be set in the config and would contain the old entries.  This happens with reload and wifi restart. So the only solution would be to manually remove the file.
